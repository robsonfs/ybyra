# YbyrÃ¡

**YbyrÃ¡** is a fun and exploratory project to reimagine GitLabâ€™s architecture using the Rust programming language and the Rocket framework. The name "YbyrÃ¡" comes from the Tupi-Guarani word for **tree**, symbolizing strength, interconnectedness, growth, and resilienceâ€”all values that align with the long-term goal of decentralizing code collaboration.

## ðŸŒ³ What is YbyrÃ¡?

YbyrÃ¡ is inspired by the architecture of [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), a well-known platform for version control, CI/CD, and project management.

My short-term goal is simple: **have fun**! I want to explore GitLabâ€™s architecture and experience the power of Rust while building something cool and educational.

## ðŸš€ Technologies

- **Rust**: For building a fast, safe, and memory-efficient backend.
- **Rocket**: A web framework for Rust that makes building fast, secure web applications fun and straightforward.
- **PostgreSQL**: For data persistence (following GitLabâ€™s approach to database management).
- **Docker**: For creating development environments and simplifying deployments.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Goals

### Short-Term
- Rebuild the core components of GitLab in **Rust** using **Rocket** (Or maybe something else) for the web interface.
- Explore GitLab's architecture and apply best practices in Rust programming.
- Enjoy the learning process and share knowledge with the community.

### Long-Term
- I haven't thought about it yet. (Actually, I did. But I'll share more once I get it more organized in my head. Because right now, it's a complete mess)
